Do not edit the '[styling]' section of these filetype.* files directly,
unless you wish to change how the style names are mapped to the
various styling states.  Many of these filetypes I am not really 
qualified to have mapped, since I only know a small number of these 
programming languages.  So if you find something that doesn't look 
right, please be sure to let me know!

If you've found an problem and don't want to create a patch yourself,
please post an 'Issue' at 
https://github.com/codebrainz/geany-themes/issues and I will take care
of it.
